# Research: Docusaurus Chapter Tasks

## Decision: Docusaurus Setup Approach
**Rationale**: Docusaurus is the optimal choice for documentation sites due to its built-in features like versioning, search, and responsive design. It's well-maintained by Meta and has extensive documentation.

## Decision: Content Organization Structure
**Rationale**: Organizing content by chapters with nested lessons follows standard educational patterns and is well-supported by Docusaurus' sidebar navigation system.

## Decision: Task Checklist Creation
**Rationale**: A comprehensive checklist ensures all necessary steps are completed during implementation and provides clear progress tracking.

## Alternatives considered:
1. **Alternative static site generators (Jekyll, Hugo)**: Rejected in favor of Docusaurus due to its superior documentation-specific features
2. **Custom React documentation site**: Rejected due to increased complexity and maintenance overhead
3. **Different content organization (flat structure)**: Rejected as it doesn't scale well for educational content

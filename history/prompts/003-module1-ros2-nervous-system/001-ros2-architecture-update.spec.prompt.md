# ROS 2 Architecture Update

## Summary
Updated Module 1 content to align with 'The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)' focus, covering all specified topics including ROS 2 architecture, rclpy integration, and URDF for humanoids.

## Task Description
- Update Module 1 content to focus on ROS 2 as the 'robotic nervous system'
- Cover ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services in detail
- Implement bridging Python AI agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- Provide comprehensive coverage of URDF for humanoid robots
- Add practical examples and code snippets throughout

## Implementation Details
- Completely revised physical-ai-book/docs/chapter1/index.mdx to focus on ROS 2 as nervous system
- Updated lesson1.mdx to cover ROS 2 architecture: Nodes, Topics, and Services
- Updated lesson2.mdx to cover bridging Python AI agents to ROS controllers with rclpy
- Updated lesson3.mdx to cover understanding URDF for humanoid robots
- Created comprehensive spec.md and plan.md files for Module 1

## Files Modified
- physical-ai-book/docs/chapter1/index.mdx
- physical-ai-book/docs/chapter1/lesson1.mdx
- physical-ai-book/docs/chapter1/lesson2.mdx
- physical-ai-book/docs/chapter1/lesson3.mdx
- specs/003-module1-ros2-nervous-system/spec.md
- specs/003-module1-ros2-nervous-system/plan.md

## Outcome
Module 1 now comprehensively covers ROS 2 architecture, AI-ROS integration with rclpy, and URDF for humanoid robots as specified. The content includes practical examples, code snippets, and hands-on activities.

## Evaluation
The updated content properly covers all specified topics with appropriate depth and practical examples. The module provides a solid foundation for understanding ROS 2 as the 'robotic nervous system' and how to integrate AI agents with ROS controllers.

# Vision-Language-Action Integration Update

## Summary
Updated Module 4 content to cover the convergence of vision, language, and action in robotics, including OpenAI Whisper for voice commands, cognitive planning with LLMs, and the Autonomous Humanoid capstone project.

## Task Description
- Update Module 4 content to focus on Vision-Language-Action integration
- Cover OpenAI Whisper integration for voice-to-action systems
- Implement cognitive planning using LLMs to translate natural language to ROS actions
- Provide comprehensive coverage of the Autonomous Humanoid capstone project
- Add practical examples and integration techniques

## Implementation Details
- Revised physical-ai-book/docs/chapter4/index.mdx to focus on VLA convergence concepts
- Updated lesson1.mdx to cover Voice-to-Action: OpenAI Whisper integration
- Updated lesson2.mdx to cover Cognitive Planning: LLMs for natural language to ROS actions
- Updated lesson3.mdx to cover the Capstone Project: Autonomous Humanoid system
- Created comprehensive spec.md and plan.md files for Module 4

## Files Modified
- physical-ai-book/docs/chapter4/index.mdx
- physical-ai-book/docs/chapter4/lesson1.mdx
- physical-ai-book/docs/chapter4/lesson2.mdx
- physical-ai-book/docs/chapter4/lesson3.mdx
- specs/006-module4-vision-language-action/spec.md
- specs/006-module4-vision-language-action/plan.md

## Outcome
Module 4 now comprehensively covers Vision-Language-Action integration with focus on voice recognition, cognitive planning with LLMs, and the complete Autonomous Humanoid system as specified.

## Evaluation
The updated content properly covers all specified topics with appropriate depth and practical examples for implementing complete autonomous humanoid systems with natural language interaction.

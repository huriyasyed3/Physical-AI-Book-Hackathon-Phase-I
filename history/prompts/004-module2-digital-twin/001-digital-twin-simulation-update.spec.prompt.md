# Digital Twin Simulation Update

## Summary
Updated Module 2 content to cover physics simulation in Gazebo, high-fidelity rendering in Unity, and sensor simulation for digital twin applications in robotics.

## Task Description
- Update Module 2 content to focus on digital twin technology using Gazebo and Unity
- Cover physics simulation fundamentals in Gazebo
- Implement high-fidelity rendering techniques in Unity
- Provide comprehensive coverage of sensor simulation (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs)
- Add practical examples and hands-on activities

## Implementation Details
- Revised physical-ai-book/docs/chapter2/index.mdx to focus on digital twin concepts
- Updated lesson1.mdx to cover physics simulation fundamentals in Gazebo
- Updated lesson2.mdx to cover high-fidelity rendering in Unity
- Updated lesson3.mdx to cover sensor simulation for realistic perception
- Created comprehensive spec.md and plan.md files for Module 2

## Files Modified
- physical-ai-book/docs/chapter2/index.mdx
- physical-ai-book/docs/chapter2/lesson1.mdx
- physical-ai-book/docs/chapter2/lesson2.mdx
- physical-ai-book/docs/chapter2/lesson3.mdx
- specs/004-module2-digital-twin/spec.md
- specs/004-module2-digital-twin/plan.md

## Outcome

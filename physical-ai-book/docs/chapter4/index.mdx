# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview

This chapter explores the convergence of vision, language, and action in Physical AI systems. We'll focus on how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be integrated with computer vision and robotics to create systems that understand natural language commands and translate them into physical actions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Integrate voice recognition systems for natural language commands
- Use LLMs for cognitive planning and task decomposition
- Implement Vision-Language models for scene understanding
- Create end-to-end Vision-Language-Action pipelines
- Develop systems that translate high-level commands into sequences of robotic actions

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have:
- Completed Chapters 1-3
- Understanding of ROS 2 and robot control systems
- Basic knowledge of deep learning and neural networks
- Familiarity with LLM concepts and APIs

## Chapter Structure

This chapter contains three lessons covering:
1. Voice-to-Action: Using OpenAI Whisper for voice commands
2. Cognitive Planning: Using LLMs to translate natural language into ROS 2 actions
3. Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid system

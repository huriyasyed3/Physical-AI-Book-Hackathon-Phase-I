# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to the foundational module of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This chapter introduces you to ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the middleware that serves as the nervous system for robotic systems. You'll learn how ROS 2 enables communication between different components of a robot, allowing them to work together seamlessly.

## What You'll Learn

In this chapter, you'll explore:
- ROS 2 architecture: Nodes, Topics, and Services
- How to bridge Python AI agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoid robots
- Setting up and configuring ROS 2 for humanoid robot control

## Prerequisites

This chapter assumes:
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with robotics concepts
- Interest in robot middleware and communication systems

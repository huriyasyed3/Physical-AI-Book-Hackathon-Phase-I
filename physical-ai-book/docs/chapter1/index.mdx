# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to the foundational module of the **Physical AI Book**. This chapter introduces you to **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**, the middleware that serves as the nervous system for robotic systems. You'll learn how ROS 2 enables communication between different components of a robot, allowing them to work together seamlessly.

## Overview

ROS 2 provides the communication infrastructure that allows different parts of a robot to work together. Think of it as the nervous system of a robot - it enables sensors to communicate with controllers, controllers to communicate with actuators, and all components to coordinate their actions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental architecture of ROS 2
- Implement basic communication patterns using nodes, topics, and services
- Bridge AI agents to robotic controllers
- Configure ROS 2 for robotic applications

## What You'll Explore

In this module, you'll delve into:
- **ROS 2 Architecture**: Understanding nodes, topics, and services
- **AI-Robot Integration**: Bridging Python AI agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- **Robot Description**: Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- **System Configuration**: Setting up and configuring ROS 2 for robotic control

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following lessons:
- **Lesson 1**: ROS 2 Architecture - Core concepts of nodes, topics, and services
- **Lesson 2**: Python Integration - Bridging AI agents to ROS controllers
- **Lesson 3**: Robot Configuration - Setting up ROS 2 for robotic applications

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with fundamental robotics concepts
- Interest in robot middleware and communication systems

## Getting Started

Begin with Lesson 1 to understand the foundational concepts of ROS 2 architecture, then progress through each lesson to build a complete understanding of how ROS 2 enables robotic communication and coordination.

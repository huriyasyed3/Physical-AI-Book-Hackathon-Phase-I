# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

In this chapter, we'll explore the concept of digital twins in Physical AI - virtual replicas of physical systems that allow for testing, simulation, and validation before deployment. We'll focus on physics simulation and environment building using Gazebo and Unity.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the role of digital twins in Physical AI development
- Set up and configure Gazebo for physics simulation
- Create realistic environments for humanoid robot testing
- Implement high-fidelity rendering for human-robot interaction
- Simulate various sensors including LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have:
- Completed Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI
- Basic understanding of physics concepts (gravity, collisions, forces)
- Familiarity with 3D environments and rendering concepts
- ROS 2 environment set up from Chapter 1

## Chapter Structure

This chapter contains three lessons covering:
1. Physics simulation fundamentals and Gazebo environment setup
2. Unity integration for high-fidelity rendering and interaction
3. Sensor simulation for realistic perception in virtual environments
